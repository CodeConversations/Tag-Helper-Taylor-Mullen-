# Tag Helpers with Taylor Mullen 

---------------------------------------

## Points of interest

- The TagHelper that was added in the show was [the Markdown TagHelper](https://github.com/CodeConversations/Tag-Helper-with-Taylor-Mullen/commit/f9ec9117cd4e534083a1f86cd81bc08eefca7f6e#diff-ea421c97bbf9fefe37072db4b0a44fe4). It enables you to write [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) in your Views.
- To enable the Markdown TagHelper in the sample application included in this repo you can add `@addTagHelper *, CreatingYourOwnTagHelpers` to the `_ViewImports.cshtml` to impact all Views or simply add it to the View you want the functionality.

## How to get the tools

1. Go to https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/ and download the Visual Studio 2017 skew of your choice.
2. When installing Visual Studio at the very least check the **ASP.NET and web development** component.
3. Open Visual Studio, ensure that you do not have any updates that you need to install. Easiest way to do this is look at the top right hand corner and you should see a flag. If it's yellow then you have updates that you need to install.

You're good to go!
