## How to get the tools

1. Go to https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/ and download the Visual Studio 2017 skew of your choice.
2. When installing Visual Studio at the very least check the **ASP.NET and web development** component.
3. Open Visual Studio, ensure that you do not have any updates that you need to install. Easiest way to do this is look at the top right hand corner and you should see a flag. If it's yellow then you have updates that you need to install.

You're good to go!
